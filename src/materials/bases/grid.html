notes: |
  The grid is fluid with just a few different options based on 4ths and 3rds. The colums are named by width ratio where 1/2 is `col-1-2` and 1/3 is `col-1-3` etc. These can be nested freely and will be sized in ration to it's parent. On smaller devices all columns will be 100% of the width.

  The grid lives inside the `container` wrapper. This keeps the main column at the right size and centered. If the page has side navigation the conainer should also have the `container-with-nav` class.

  To get the correct padding the inner most content is to be wrapped in a div with the class `content`. One can also add `content-paper` or `content-sink` to style the container.

      Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
